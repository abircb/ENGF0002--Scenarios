# ENGF0002: Design and Professional Skills

## Introduction
The goal of this scenario project is to help understand that approaching a new programming language requires a security mindset. It wonâ€™t be about computer security per se, but it will be the mindset that comes with it: of probing, asking questions, looking for ways in which things might not fit together, etc.

## The Challenge
### Mystery Languages (MLs)
<ul>
  <li>Eight different sets of languages with unspecified behaviour- MLs</li>
  <li>In each ML in a set, some language feature is implemented differently</li>
  <li>Examples of features: Arithmetic operations, conditional statements, nested functions, mutable variables, scoping, records with mutable fields, etc.</li>
  <li>In each of the eight tasks, the goal is to provide a set of classifiers: small test programs allowing to tell different MLs apart.</li>
</ul>

### Proto Language [(Pyret)](https://www.pyret.org)
<ul>
  <li>Similar to Python in syntax of functions and iterations</li>
  <li>Runs in your browser</li>
</ul>
